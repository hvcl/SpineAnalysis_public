# A Unified Visualization Framework for Interactive Dendritic Spine Analysis using 3D Morphological Features

![Workflow of the spine analysis](workflow.png)

- Tested running environment: Windows 10, 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) data (0.032um x 0.032um x 0.12um) 
- Requirements for program execution: [Visual C++](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- Requirements for dimension reduction methods: python, sklearn, numpy
- Requirements for spine detection: matlab
- Test dataset is included /Executable/dataset/neuron3
- For testing: 
  run /Executable/SpineAnalysis.exe => add group by pressing + button => load /Executable/dataset/neuron3/dataset.DXplorerInfo by pressing + button on the generated group
